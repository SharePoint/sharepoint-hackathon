## SharePoint Hackathon 2026 details

✨ **Design, Create and Share!** ✨

We are excited to invite you to a **hackathon** dedicated to **crafting engaging experiences using AI and the latest SharePoint features**! 💡

**SharePoint is the knowledge platform for Copilot and agents**. It brings together powerful new features for building visually rich, engaging experiences while infusing sites and content with the latest AI‑powered capabilities. As the knowledge platform for Microsoft 365, SharePoint provides the structured, governed fabric that Copilot agents rely on to access and reason over organizational content.

SharePoint’s extensibility platform spans low‑code customization, the full‑code [SharePoint Framework](https://aka.ms/spfx) (SPFx), and [SharePoint Embedded](https://aka.ms/spe), providing customers and partners with flexible ways to tailor experiences, adapt UI behavior, build custom solutions, and extend AI‑driven scenarios to meet unique business needs.

👋 **This hackathon is open to everyone!** Whether you're an end user, designer, architect, or developer, there's a place for you. The SharePoint Hackathon will showcase the diverse possibilities within the SharePoint ecosystem.

Submission categories include:

* Best organized library using Knowledge Agent
* Best use of custom agents with SharePoint
* Designs utilizing out-of-the-box features
* UX extensible experiences with SPFx
* Integration scenarios with SharePoint Embedded
* and more...

If you've created a SharePoint site and tailored it to meet your business needs, you're all set to participate! The possibilities are endless for what you can create... plus, you can submit your hack for a chance to win exciting prizes! 🥳

**SharePoint Hackathon runs from March 2nd to March 16th**. Hack submissions are due Monday March 16th 2026, 11:59 PM PST. Join us! 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️

**Do I need to be a developer for this hackathon?**

No. Anyone can **create beautiful looking pages in SharePoint or use the SharePoint agents** to increase their productivity. Anyone can submit their work for the competition and everyone is awarded with a badge to do so.

**We have a product build for/with SharePoint - can we submit?**

Yes. Anyone can submit to this hackathon. If you are a partner who has created an intranet-in-a-box offering, you can also submit your design or agent scenarios for this hackathon. Any submission which contains SPFx customizations would fall on that specific category and we'll take the submission background also into account in the judging.

Notice that *we are looking into engaging with our SharePoint partner ecosystem* more closely also with specific partner showcase blog posts and interviews. See [example story](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/spblog/ai-powered-intranet-solution-built-on-sharepoint---fresh-intranet---sharepoint-p/4465709) and volunteer for a story by submitting [this form](https://aka.ms/sharepoint/partner/showcase).

**Do I need to create something new or can I submit video of what we already have?**

You are NOT expected specifically to create any new designs or code during this hackathon, so if you already have a beautiful intranet or are for example using SharePoint Agents in intersting scenarios, those stories are also welcome.

We want everyone to be able to submit their beautiful UX designs, SharePoint Agents stories or SPFx experiences for the competition to showcase the art of possible within SharePoint.

**What will be expected from the submissions?**

There is only two things to do for each submissions:

1. Create a video which showcases what you have created

**We have a cool SharePoint design on our intranet, can I submit that?**

Yes as long as you have permission from your company or the service owner to do that. We are excited to see what kind of use cases you have with SharePoint Agents and what kind of designs our customers and partners have created with SharePoint.

**How should I create the video for submission?**

There are multiple ways to do this. Key is to highlight the design and features you have in your deployment. You can use whatever software you like for recording and then submit the entry to us in a location which can be accessed. This could mean attaching video on the submission entry, video in YouTube (can be unlisted if link works) or by sharing a video with file sharing services, like with OneDrive.

**How many people can be in a team which is building a submission?**

One submission can be from 1-4 people. You can submit as an individual person, or you can join with other community members to build a team with maximum 4 persons in the team.

**Can one submission be for multiple cateogries?**

Yes. When you are submitting the details, you can select the categories which are relevant for your submission. One submission can below to multiple categories. One submission can also win multiple categories, but in that case, only one set of awards are provided for the winnin team.
