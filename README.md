**What will be expected from the submissions?**

There are two important things to do for each submissions:

**We have a cool SharePoint design on our intranet, can I submit that?**

Yes as long as you have permission from your company or the service owner to do that. We are excited to see what kind of use cases you have with SharePoint Agents and what kind of designs our customers and partners have created with SharePoint and Viva Connections.

**How should I create the video for submission?**

There are multiple ways to do this. Key is to showcase the design and features you have in your deployment. You can use whatever software you like for recording and then submit the entry to us in a location which can be accessed.
